=RUBSUB=

This is based on the concept of RVM, but is designed to run entirely
as ruby.

RVM: Information on RVM is available at http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/
Thanks to Wayne E. Seguin for helping out.

WARNING: This is still alpha code; Don't expect anything to work!  Use
RVM if you need something to actually work. :-)

==Quickstart==

curl -q http://github.com/docwhat/rubsub/raw/stable/rubsub-install.sh | bash

(yup, it's that simple)

==Todo==
 * gemset support
 * add other rubies (jruby, macruby, ree)

==Solutions==

===A Reliable Ruby===

We will download and compile miniruby.  This will give us a static, simple ruby
with a lot of features.

Implemented in rubsub-install.sh

===per-shell status===

Use a "session-key" to control the rubsub configuration.

I have two thoughts:
  # Use $SHELL-$$ -- This is not guaranteed unique, especially given infinite time.
  # Require that your shell run "eval rubsub --start-session" which creates an environment
    with a read-only session id.

===Getting the code===

Currently, all that is implemented a local install version.  It works
only via the environment variable "LOCAL_INSTALL=yes".
