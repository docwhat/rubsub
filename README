=RUBSUB=

This is (currently) a prototype to see if we can run RubSub entirely
within ruby.

WARNING: Don't expect anything to work!

==Quickstart==

curl -q http://github.com/docwhat/rubsub2/raw/stable/rubsub-install.sh | bash

(yup, it's that simple)

==Todo==
 * gemset support
 * add other rubies (jruby, macruby, ree)

==Solutions==

===A Reliable Ruby===

We will download and compile miniruby.  This will give us a static, simple ruby
with a lot of features.

Implemented in rubsub-install.sh

===per-shell status===

Use a "session-key" to control the rubsub configuration.

I have two thoughts:
  # Use $SHELL-$$ -- This is not guaranteed unique, especially given infinite time.
  # Require that your shell run "eval rubsub --start-session" which creates an environment
    with a read-only session id.

===Getting the code===

Currently, all that is implemented a local install version.  It works
only via the environment variable "LOCAL_INSTALL=yes".
