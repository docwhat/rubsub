=RVM2=

This is (currently) a prototype to see if we can run RVM entirely within ruby.

==Known Issues==
  * We need a reliable ruby to work with. We don't want to rely on a system ruby.
  * We need a way to allow each shell instance to (potentially) use a different ruby version. We don't want a 'system wide' switch of ruby versions.

==Solutions==

===A Reliable Ruby===

We will download and compile miniruby.  This will give us a static, simple ruby
with a lot of features.

Implemented in rvm-install.sh

===per-shell status===

Use a "session-key" to control the rvm configuration.

I have two thoughts:
  # Use $SHELL-$$ -- This is not guaranteed unique, especially given infinite time.
  # Require that your shell run "eval rvm --start-session" which creates an environment
    with a read-only session id.

Ciao!
